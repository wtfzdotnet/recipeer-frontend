# User Story: Enhanced Login Form with Multi-Provider Authentication & Passkey Support

## Epic: Authentication & Authorization System
**Repository:** wtfzdotnet/recipeer-frontend  
**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 13  
**Sprint:** Authentication Implementation

---

## User Story

**As a** Recipeer user  
**I want** to securely authenticate using multiple methods including social providers and passwordless passkeys  
**So that** I can quickly and securely access my account with my preferred authentication method

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### 🔐 Core Authentication Requirements

**Given** I am on the Recipeer login page  
**When** I want to sign in  
**Then** I should see the following authentication options:
- [ ] Traditional email/password login
- [ ] Google OAuth sign-in
- [ ] Facebook OAuth sign-in  
- [ ] Microsoft OAuth sign-in
- [ ] Passkey authentication (WebAuthn)

### 🚀 Social Authentication Providers

**Given** I choose a social provider  
**When** I click the provider button  
**Then** I should:
- [ ] Be redirected to the provider's OAuth flow
- [ ] Return to Recipeer with successful authentication
- [ ] Have my profile populated with provider data where available
- [ ] Be able to link multiple providers to one account

### 🔑 Passkey Authentication

**Given** I have a compatible device and browser  
**When** I choose passkey authentication  
**Then** I should:
- [ ] See a "Sign in with Passkey" option
- [ ] Be prompted to use my device's biometric/PIN authentication
- [ ] Be authenticated without entering passwords
- [ ] Have the option to register a new passkey during account creation

### 🎨 UI/UX Requirements

**Given** I'm viewing the login form  
**When** I interact with authentication options  
**Then** I should see:
- [ ] Clear visual hierarchy with primary/secondary authentication methods
- [ ] Loading states during authentication processes
- [ ] Appropriate error messages for failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Accessible buttons with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- [ ] Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Provider-specific branding and icons

### 📱 Responsive Design

**Given** I'm accessing the login form on different devices  
**When** I view the authentication options  
**Then** they should:
- [ ] Stack vertically on mobile devices
- [ ] Display in a grid on larger screens
- [ ] Maintain proper touch targets (44px minimum)
- [ ] Scale icons and text appropriately

### 🔒 Security Requirements

**Given** I'm authenticating through any method  
**When** the authentication process occurs  
**Then** it should:
- [ ] Use HTTPS for all authentication flows
- [ ] Implement proper CSRF protection
- [ ] Store authentication tokens securely
- [ ] Support secure logout from all providers
- [ ] Handle authentication errors gracefully

interface AuthLoginFormProps {
  onSuccess?: (user: User) => void;
  onError?: (error: AuthError) => void;
  providers?: AuthProvider[];
  enablePasskey?: boolean;
  compact?: boolean;
  redirectUrl?: string;
}

interface AuthProvider {
  id: 'google' | 'facebook' | 'microsoft';
  name: string;
  icon: React.ComponentType;
  enabled: boolean;
}
```

## User Journey Flows

### 🎯 Primary Flow: Social Authentication
1. User visits login page
2. User sees traditional login form with social options below
3. User clicks preferred social provider (Google/Facebook/Microsoft)
4. User is redirected to provider's OAuth consent screen
5. User authorizes application
6. User is redirected back to Recipeer with authentication token
7. User profile is created/updated with provider information
8. User is redirected to dashboard/intended destination

### 🔑 Passkey Flow
1. User visits login page
2. User clicks "Sign in with Passkey" button
3. Browser prompts for biometric/PIN authentication
4. User authenticates with device
5. Authentication challenge is verified
6. User is signed in and redirected

### ⚠️ Error Handling Flow
1. Authentication attempt fails
2. User sees contextual error message
3. User can retry with same or different method
4. Multiple failed attempts trigger rate limiting
5. User can access account recovery options

4. **Phase 4:** Passkey/WebAuthn implementation
5. **Phase 5:** Account linking and management

### 🎨 Design Considerations
- Maintain visual consistency with existing Button and Input components
- Ensure social provider buttons follow brand guidelines
- Consider dark mode compatibility for all authentication elements
- Implement proper loading states to prevent user confusion

### 🔧 Technical Notes
- Use React Context for authentication state management
- Implement proper error boundaries for authentication flows
- Consider implementing refresh token rotation for enhanced security
- Plan for future addition of more authentication providers
