# Design System Audit Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for auditing design system compliance across all components in the Frontend Recipeer application. The audit framework ensures consistency, accessibility, and maintainability of our atomic design-based component system.

## Quick Start

1. **Review the [Audit Criteria](./audit-criteria.md)** to understand evaluation standards
2. **Familiarize yourself with the [Scoring Methodology](./scoring-methodology.md)** for consistent evaluation
3. **Download the [Component Tracking Template](./component-audit-template.csv)** to track audit progress
4. **Use the [Audit Report Template](./audit-report-template.md)** to document findings
5. **Reference the [Accessibility Checklist](./accessibility-checklist.md)** for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## Documentation Structure

## Audit Framework

### Evaluation Areas (100 points total)

1. **Design Token Compliance** (25 points)
   - Color usage and theme integration
   - Typography scale adherence
   - Spacing consistency

2. **Visual Consistency** (25 points)
   - Component variants and states
   - Layout patterns and responsive design
   - Visual hierarchy

3. **Accessibility Compliance** (25 points)
   - WCAG 2.1 AA requirements
   - Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
   - Interactive accessibility

4. **Theme Support** (15 points)
   - Light/dark mode adaptation
   - System theme detection

5. **Documentation Quality** (10 points)
   - Storybook documentation completeness
   - Code documentation and examples

### Component Priority Levels

- **Critical (90+ score required)**: Foundational atoms (Button, Input, Typography)
- **High (80+ score required)**: Key molecules and organisms (QuantityAdjuster, RecipeCard)
- **Medium (70+ score required)**: Complex organisms and templates
- **Low (60+ score required)**: Experimental or legacy components

## Audit Process

### 1. Planning Phase
- [ ] Identify components for audit using priority levels
- [ ] Assign auditors and schedule audit dates
- [ ] Set up tracking system using component template

### 2. Evaluation Phase
- [ ] Score components using detailed criteria
- [ ] Document findings with evidence
- [ ] Identify issues and improvement opportunities

### 3. Reporting Phase
- [ ] Complete audit reports using standard template
- [ ] Prioritize issues by severity
- [ ] Create actionable improvement plans

### 4. Remediation Phase
- [ ] Address critical and major issues
- [ ] Re-audit improved components
- [ ] Update tracking system with results

### 5. Continuous Improvement
- [ ] Schedule regular re-audits
- [ ] Update criteria based on learnings
- [ ] Share best practices across team

## Getting Started with Audits

### For New Auditors

1. **Read the documentation**: Start with audit criteria and scoring methodology
2. **Review examples**: Examine existing components in Storybook
3. **Practice scoring**: Audit a simple atom component to understand the process
4. **Shadow experienced auditor**: Observe an audit session for complex components
5. **Start with low-risk audits**: Begin with non-critical components

### For Component Developers

1. **Understand the criteria**: Review audit standards before building components
2. **Use the accessibility checklist**: Ensure WCAG compliance during development
3. **Test across themes**: Verify light/dark mode support
4. **Document thoroughly**: Create comprehensive Storybook stories
5. **Self-audit before submission**: Use the criteria to review your own work

## Tools and Resources

### Required Tools
- **Storybook**: Component documentation and visual testing
- **Browser DevTools**: Accessibility and contrast checking
- **axe DevTools**: Automated accessibility testing
- **Screen reader software**: Manual accessibility testing

### Recommended Tools
- **WAVE**: Web accessibility evaluation
- **Lighthouse**: Performance and accessibility auditing
- **Color contrast analyzers**: Ensuring WCAG compliance
- **Figma**: Design comparison and measurement

### Learning Resources
- [WCAG 2.1 Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/)
- [Atomic Design Methodology](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)
- [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/)

## Quality Assurance

### Audit Consistency
- Multiple auditors should review high-priority components
- Regular calibration sessions to maintain scoring consistency
- Cross-validation of audit results for critical components

### Continuous Improvement
- Quarterly review of audit criteria and methodology
- Integration of new accessibility requirements
- Update processes based on team feedback and industry best practices

## Support and Questions

### Getting Help
- Review the detailed [Scoring Methodology](./scoring-methodology.md) for specific guidance
- Consult the [Accessibility Checklist](./accessibility-checklist.md) for WCAG questions
- Reach out to the design system team for clarification
