# ADR-0001: Atomic Design Component Architecture

## Status
Accepted (2024-12-29)

## Context
Our React application was experiencing several organizational and development challenges:

1. **Inconsistent component organization** - Components were scattered without clear hierarchy
2. **Difficulty finding and reusing components** - No clear patterns for component discovery
3. **Scattered Storybook structure** - Stories not organized by component relationships
4. **AI assistant confusion** - Code generation tools couldn't follow our patterns consistently
5. **New developer onboarding issues** - Complex component relationships were unclear
6. **Scaling concerns** - Growing codebase needed better architectural foundation

As the project grows with more components and team members, we needed a scalable, consistent approach to component organization that would improve developer experience and maintain code quality.

## Decision
We have adopted **Atomic Design methodology** with **Component-Driven Development (CDD)** practices as our primary architectural pattern for organizing React components.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Atomic Hierarchy Structure
```
src/components/
├── atoms/          # Basic building blocks (Button, Input, Typography)
├── molecules/      # Simple combinations (QuantityAdjuster, Alert, Card)  
├── organisms/      # Complex sections (RecipeCard, LoginForm, Dialog)
├── templates/      # Page layouts (RecipePageLayout)
└── ui/            # shadcn/ui foundation components (wrapped by atoms)
```

#### 2. Component Isolation Rules
- **Unidirectional Dependencies**: Components can only import from lower levels
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **No Business Logic in Atoms**: Atoms remain pure presentation components
- **Molecules combine 2-5 atoms**: Simple functional units with minimal logic
- **Organisms handle complexity**: Business logic, state management, data fetching

#### 3. File Organization Standards
```
component-name/
├── component-name.tsx          # Main component
├── ComponentName.stories.tsx   # Storybook stories  
├── ComponentName.test.tsx      # Unit tests
└── index.ts                   # Clean barrel export
```

#### 4. Storybook Organization
- Stories organized by atomic levels: `"Atoms/Button"`, `"Molecules/Alert"`, etc.
- Each component requires comprehensive stories demonstrating all variants
- Realistic mock data and usage examples in stories
- Co-located stories with components for better maintainability

#### 5. TypeScript Interface Requirements
- Comprehensive props interfaces with JSDoc documentation
- Type exports alongside component exports  
- Clear prop descriptions and usage examples
- Accessibility considerations built into interfaces

### AI Assistant Integration
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with detailed architectural guidelines
- AI assistants now automatically follow atomic design principles
- Consistent component generation following established patterns
- Proper TypeScript interfaces and Storybook stories generated

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Feature-Based Organization
```
src/
├── features/
│   ├── auth/components/
│   ├── recipes/components/
│   └── profile/components/
```
**Rejected**: While good for large applications, doesn't solve component reusability across features and makes it harder to build a cohesive design system.

### 2. Flat Component Structure
```
src/components/
├── Button.tsx
├── RecipeCard.tsx
├── LoginForm.tsx
```
**Rejected**: Doesn't scale well, no clear component relationships, difficult to understand complexity levels.

### 3. Traditional Component + UI Library
```
src/
├── components/
└── ui/ (shadcn only)
```
**Rejected**: Doesn't provide clear guidelines for component complexity or reusability patterns.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Clear Component Hierarchy**: Developers can easily understand component relationships and complexity levels
- **Improved Reusability**: Atomic components can be composed into various molecules and organisms
- **Better Developer Experience**: Clear patterns for finding, creating, and modifying components
- **AI Assistant Compatibility**: Tools generate code following established patterns consistently
- **Scalable Architecture**: Structure supports growth without becoming unwieldy
- **Design System Foundation**: Provides strong base for evolving design system
- **Testing Strategy**: Clear testing levels (atoms = unit, organisms = integration)
- **Storybook Organization**: Component relationships visible in documentation

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand atomic design principles
- **Initial Overhead**: More files and structure per component
- **Import Path Complexity**: Deeper nested imports (mitigated by barrel exports)
- **Potential Over-Engineering**: Risk of creating atoms that could be simple elements

### Migration Impact
- **Existing Components**: Gradually migrated to atomic structure without breaking changes
- **shadcn/ui Integration**: Preserved as foundation layer, wrapped by atomic components
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained through barrel exports during transition
- **Storybook Updates**: All components now have comprehensive stories

## Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1** (Week 1): Foundation setup, AI instructions, templates
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 2-3): Component migration (atoms → molecules → organisms)  
- **Phase 3** (Week 4): Storybook stories and testing coverage
- **Phase 4** (Week 5): Documentation and team training

## Monitoring
We will monitor the success of this decision through:
- **Developer Survey**: Quarterly assessment of component discovery and usage
- **Code Review Metrics**: Consistency in component organization
- **AI Generation Quality**: Percentage of AI-generated components following patterns
- **Onboarding Time**: New developer time-to-productivity metrics
- **Component Reusability**: Metrics on component usage across features
